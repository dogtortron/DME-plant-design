# Executive Summary

In this project, I collaborated with three engineers to design a process that can produce 70,000 metric tons per year of 99.9 wt% DME from a feedstock of methanol. Our team performed material and energy balances, researched environmental regulations, and used ASPEN software to design the process. A detailed economic analysis was performed, yielding a 17% internal rate of return.
